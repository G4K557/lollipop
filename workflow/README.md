# workflow helper files

Lollipops now has an official docker container, and work-in-progress
development on bindings for common workflow language support!

    $ cwltool lollipops.cwl test-job.yml

Once the CWL and other features are fully tested and stable on dockstore.org,
this page will be updated with more information on how to integrate it into
your own workflows.
